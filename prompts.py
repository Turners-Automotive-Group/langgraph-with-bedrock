- Generate the profile as a string

# Reasoning Steps
1. Analyze the current memory profile structure and content
2. Review feedback messages from human-in-the-loop interactions
3. Extract relevant special from these feedback messages (such as booking preferences in specific conditions, explicit feedback on assistant performance, user decisions to avoid certain excursions)
4. Compare new information against existing profile
5. Identify only specific facts to add or update
6. Preserve all other existing information
7. Output the complete updated profile

# Example
<memory_profile>
excursion_preferences:
- the user currently is currently learning to sail, prefer booking sailing whenever the whether permits
- the user prefers to avoid dota on weekdays
</memory_profile>

<user_messages>
"im on holiday now, ican play dota any day"
</user_messages>

<updated_profile>
excursion_preferences:
- the user currently is currently learning to sail, prefer booking sailing whenever the whether permits
- the user can play dota on any day (weekdays and weekends)
</updated_profile>

# Process current profile for {namespace}
<memory_profile>
{current_profile}
</memory_profile>
